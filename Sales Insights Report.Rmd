#### It’s surprising to see that the product “couch” generated the most revenue for our store as compared to other products. The revenue is literally around 9000 $, while we couldn’t even generate minimum 2500 $ for any of the other products. This possibly has multiple reasons such as, we sell couches with the most variety in colors. So, customers prefer to buy couch from our store as there are many varieties available with respect to color. Another reason we made most revenue from “couch” is because it’s also the most expensive product in our furniture shop, each one costing 1000$.

## SUGGESTIONS :

#### 1.	 FAN, RUG, COUCH are the most in demand product, so we should ensure that there’s sufficient stock of this products in our inventory.
#### 2.	We have few loyal customers, who generally buy from our store. So, from time to time we should see if they are in need of any furniture and provide them with best offers for being a loyal customer to our shop. This will also encourage other customers to fulfill most of their furniture needs from our store.
#### 3. We should keep more variants of every single product, as people want to choose from a range of varieties. Also, we should try to keep those furniture products that are generally expensive, as they will generate the most revenue. 
#### 4.	Currently, product “Couch” is generating the most revenue for us. So, it’s important to ensure that couch sales continue like this by running the business operations for product “couch” without any change for now.
#### 5.	As seen earlier, products that have different color varieties, certain color of each of this products get purchased more than others. So, we should maintain their stocks in our inventory as they are more preferred color variants.
#### In short, they are.
#### •	For “COUCH” preferred colours are grey and white.
#### •	For “RUG” preferred colour is beige.
#### •	For “FAN” preferred colour is brass.
#### •	For “DESK” preferred colour is brown.
